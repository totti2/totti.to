Personal docker-based homeserver

This is more like a storage of my setup- and config-files than an actual code repo. Yet this will contain useful stuff needed for setting up something similar.

VPS at netcup:
- mailu

udoo ultra at home
- nextcloud

Raspberry 3B at home
- pihole
- Wireguard

I made a lot of mistakes while administrating my cloud-services before. "Admin-Error", so "mis-debugging" or "mis-updating" when in daily use, left the system unusable. Also, I had only a few security measurements set up. fail2ban, full disk encryption, ufw and spamhaus.

I there want to
1. Satbilize the system
2. Create a stable admin, update and debug rhythm
To prioritize my activities I started with a FMEA using [this](https://medium.com/@adrianco/failure-modes-and-continuous-resilience-6553078caad5) spreadsheet as a template. I bet I made some mistakes and of course the evaluation considers my perosnal setup only. So there is much room for interpretation.
